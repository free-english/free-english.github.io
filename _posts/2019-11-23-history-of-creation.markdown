Free English app was built during Android Academy Minsk 24 hour hackathon.
We gathered 22.11.2019 at 16:00 and then some magic happened:
after 24 hours of work we got the first version of Free English.

You can see our team the photo (from left to right):

* Kirill Chernyshev

Majority of work was made by Kirill, Sergey, and Diana.
All of them are students of Android Academy so it was the first Android project for them.
We'd like to say thank you very much to Max, who drew app's design.
