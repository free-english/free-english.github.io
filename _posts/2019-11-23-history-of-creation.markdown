Free English app was built during Android Academy Minsk 24 hour hackathon.
We gathered 22.11.2019 at 16:00 and then some magic happened:
after 24 hours of work we got the first version of Free English.

You can see our team the photo (from left to right):
* Sergei Tsybliyenko (mentor, Synesis)
* Max Luzin
* Vadzim Vysotski (mentor, Godel Technologies)
* Michael
* Kirill Chernyshev
* Sergey Savitsky
* Diana	Lobach

Majority of work was made by Kirill, Sergey, and Diana.
All of them are students of Android Academy so it was the first Android project for them.
Everybody got a lot of new experience.
Students learned how to work as a team: git, communication,
it was a lot of new technologies for them which is related to Android development.
Mentors learned how to organize a team, split and parallel backlog, explain new things to students.

It was a challenging event for all of us:
we resisted to fall asleep,
learned new things on the spot, 
discussed all the features over and over again util we found perfect balance between technical complexity and value for users.

We'd like to say thank you very much to Max, who drew app's design, you're amazing!
