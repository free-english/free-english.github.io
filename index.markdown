![Free English](/assets/free-english-full-logo.svg)

English language is full of things that don't follow any logic rules:
phrasal verbs, collocations, etc.
Free English helps people learn English via regular tests:
you pass few tests everyday,
so that you repeat what you already know,
or learn something new.
For now Free English supports only phrasal verbs.

The best things in your life comes for free: Love, Family, Friendship and of course Free English.
Whole application and content is build by community for community!
